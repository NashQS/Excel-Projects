# Project Overview
This project involved the creation of a BOQ for a residential house using Excel. The project focuses on showing all steps from quantufying, building up rates for materials, labour, and equipment.
# Tools
The project was produced using Excel.

# Project Steps
## 1.Quantification of the House

    Extract key dimensions, layout, and structural details from drawings.
    Quantity Take-off: Break down each component (e.g., foundation, walls, roofing) and quantify materials and resources required (such as cement, bricks, steel, and labor).

## 2. Building Up Rates

    Material Costs: Identify local suppliers and get costs for each material. Include wastage percentages for accurate budgeting.
    Labor Costs: Use labor rates per hour or task. Include costs for specialized labor if needed.
    Plant and Equipment: Consider costs for machinery, like excavators or mixers, based on time or project requirements.
    Overheads and Profit Margin: Add company overheads, administrative costs, and desired profit to finalize rates for each item.

## 3. Producing a Dashboard

    Data Collection and Setup: Input the quantified data and calculated rates into Excel or another data tool.
    Visualization: Design charts or graphs showing cost breakdowns, material usage, labor distribution, and project timelines.
    Tracking Metrics: Set up fields for real-time updates on cost variances, progress, and resource usage, creating a user-friendly view of project status.

## 4. Creating a Program of Works

    Identify Tasks and Durations: List all tasks with estimated durations based on the scope of work.
    Scheduling: Allocate tasks sequentially, allowing for dependencies (e.g., foundation completion before walls).
    Milestones and Timeline: Set key project milestones and deadlines, marking completion points for each phase.
    Gantt Chart: Develop a Gantt chart to visually represent task durations and dependencies, allowing for easy tracking of progress.rements.
